## How these slides are built

[hieroglyph][heir] lets you generate HTML presentations from plain text
sources using reStructuredText and the Python Sphinx documentation
project.

When working on the slides, you can run a local livereload server to
edit the text and see the changes reflected immediately in the
browser. Just run ``python livehtml.py`` and navigate to
``http://localhost:5500``.
